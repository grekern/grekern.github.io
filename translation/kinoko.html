    The hatsutake, matsutake, shiitake, wood ear, white mushroom, common mushroom, slimy mushroom, frost-streaked mushroom, lion mushroom, mouse mushroom, leather mushroom, rice shoro fungus, barley shoro fungus and all the other mushrooms and fungi had gathered one night and began their meeting. First, the hatsutake stood up and introduced himself. <br \><br \>

“Everyone, as a chill has entered the air of late, the time is growing near when we shall be retreating into the ground. Tonight is our farewell party, so please be sure to address the group with any matters that come to mind. I will write them up for our newspaper.”<br \><br \>

Everyone clapped and the shiitake stood up next.<br \><br \>

“Everyone, I am a shiitake. Lately, I’ve been prized by humans, who go to the trouble of rotting out logs to make beds for us, thanks to which I have a large, fine set of little ones coming in. I think that every mushroom should similarly hope for the humans to make them a place to grow.”<br \><br \>

Everyone cheered in approval. Next, the matsutake cleared his throat with an “ahem” and began to speak.<br \><br \>

“Everyone, what we are here on this earth to do, first of all, is to spread our umbrella caps and scatter our spores to plant the next generation, and then to be eaten by humans, but for some reason they have been picking us before we have opened our umbrellas. And they won’t even make us beds like the shiitake have received. At this rate, I still haven’t spread my spores, and the next generations will have to be eradicated. Why the humans don’t understand this is beyond me.”<br \><br \>

And, tears flowing, everyone joined a sympathetic chorus of, “That’s right! That’s right!”<br \><br \>

Just then, a throaty laugh bubbled up from the rear. When they looked, they saw that it came from the fly-catcher mushroom, crimson mushroom, rope-sandal mushroom, horse dung mushroom, fox’s lantern, fox’s teabag and the rest of the poisonous mushrooms.<br \><br \>

From that crowd of poisonous mushrooms, the biggest fly-catcher mushroom stood up in the middle of the rest and loudly announced, “You all are fools. You get plucked like that because you serve a purpose in the world. If you were useless, they wouldn’t bother you. You should just aim to thrive among your own kind. Look at us. Without any good to offer the world, we’ve become poisonous. If even a fly tried just a bit of me, I’d kill him in a flash. The great mushrooms even kill humans year in, year out. So thrive, without demanding anything of the world. You all should figure out a way to become poisonous too.”<br \><br \>

Hearing this, everyone was dumbfounded by his argument, and some even said “I see, if we became poisonous, we’d have nothing to fear.”<br \><br \>

In the meantime, day had broken and some humans had come mushroom-picking, but everyone was still divided by the poisonous mushroom’s speech, whether they thought they should become poisonous themselves, or not, or just try it for a bit and see.<br \><br \>

The mushroom-pickers were a father and mother and big sister and baby brother, come from who knows where, and when they arrived at this spot, they were overjoyed and said, “I didn’t think there would be so many out now, but there are lots and lots of different kinds here!”<br \><br \>

“Oh, don’t just pluck them willy-nilly like that. You have to pick them carefully so you don’t crush them.”<br \><br \>

“Leave the littlest ones behind. I’d feel bad picking them now.”<br \><br \>

“Look, there’s more over there! And over here!”<br \><br \>

There was much commotion.<br \><br \>

Just then, the father noticed something and said, “Hey, everyone, be careful. There are poison mushrooms growing here too. Keep an eye out. These ones are all poison. If you eat them, you’ll die!”<br \><br \>

The mushrooms all thought it was great to be poisonous. The poison mushrooms said, “Told you so!” in a patronizing tone.<br \><br \>

By then, the father had picked just about every last mushroom, and said, “All right, let’s go.”<br \><br \>

But then, the big sister and baby brother stopped and said, “The poisonous mushrooms all look awfully scary.”<br \><br \>

“Yeah, I’ll show ‘em!”<br \><br \>

With that, he began stomping the poison mushrooms flat, one by one, large and small, and smashed them all to bits.<br \><br \>
