The patient came out from under the anesthesia from his surgery, and looked at my face.<br \><br \>

His right arm was thickly bandaged, giving him no idea it had been amputated at the wrist.<br \><br \>

He was a well-known pianist, so for him to lose his right hand was fatal. The culprit might’ve been a colleague who envied his renown.<br \><br \>

On the road at night, a passer-by had used a sharp blade to sever his wrist joint from above, and he had passed out.<br \><br \>

Fortunately, this occurred near my clinic, where he was brought in still unconscious, and I had done what I could to treat him.<br \><br \>

“Ah, you’re the one who helped me. Thanks. I’d been drinking that night, and some guy attacked me in the street. It was my right hand, right? I wonder if my fingers are okay.”<br \><br \>

“You’re fine. Your arm’s a little messed up, but it’ll heal with time.”<br \><br \>

I couldn’t stand to let him down, so I decided to hide the fact that his career as a pianist was over. I’d tell him when he was recovered enough to handle it.<br \><br \>

“My fingers too? Will they still move like they used to?”<br \><br \>

“You’ll be fine.”<br \><br \>

I got up from the bed and left the hospital room like I was running away.<br \><br \>

I told the attending nurse, in no uncertain terms, that for a while anyway, the patient was not to be informed that his hand was gone.<br \><br \>

About two hours later, I went by his room to check in on him.<br \><br \>

The patient had perked up considerably. But he still didn’t have the strength to examine his own right hand. He still didn’t know it was gone.<br \><br \>

“Is there any pain?” I asked, looking down at him.<br \><br \>

“It’s much better now,” he said, staring at me. His left hand, resting on his blanket, began to move, as if playing a piano.<br \><br \>

“It’s all right if I try moving my right hand just a little, isn’t it? I just wrote a new piece, and I feel like I’ve gotta work on it every day at least once.”<br \><br \>

I was taken aback, but while motioning for him not to move his injured hand, I quickly understood: the ulnar nerve in his forearm receives signals from his fingers. When that occurs, even without actually having fingers, the sensation of having them would be conveyed to his central nervous system.<br \><br \>

The fingers on his left hand moved in a flurry over his blanket.<br \><br \>

“Yeah, my right hand is fine. It still moves,” he murmured, absorbed in playing his composition.<br \><br \>

I couldn’t watch. I shot the nurse a glance, communicating with her in much the same way the patient’s right hand was communicating with his nervous system, and left the room.<br \><br \>

And, as I passed by the surgery room, I saw a lone nurse, standing stock-still, staring at a shelf that was up against one wall.<br \><br \>

She seemed strange. Her face was pale, her eyes were opened wider than usual, fixed on something on that shelf.<br \><br \>

I entered the room without thinking twice, and looked at the shelf. It held a large glass jar, containing the patient’s hand in an alcohol solution.<br \><br \>

One look at that, and I froze completely.<br \><br \>

In the alcohol solution in the jar, his hand, no, his five fingers, were moving like the legs of a white crab.<br \><br \>

They moved like they were hitting piano keys, but the movements were much more subtle than you’d expect, hesitant, like a small child’s, but they kept moving. <br \><br \></td>
