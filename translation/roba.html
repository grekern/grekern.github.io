Chō bought a lovely donkey. But when he made her walk, he noticed she had a limp. <br \><br \>

“Why is she limping?” he thought, but he couldn’t tell. He stopped a sage who happened to be walking by at that moment, and asked him. The sage carefully inspected the donkey before responding, “There’s a bald spot the size of a coin in between her ears. When the wind hits it, the donkey gets cold, and that’s why she limps. You should make a hat for her to wear.” <br \><br \>

Trust a sage to give wise advice, Chō thought, impressed, and made a round hat out of wool. He put it on the donkey’s head and made her walk again, but still she walked with a limp. Thinking he’d been tricked by the sage, Chō turned bright red, and dragged the donkey along.<br \><br \>

“You can’t just trick people like this! I made a hat for her to wear, just like you said, but it hasn’t done a thing for her limp!” Chō said, and the sage calmly replied, “No, this hat won't do. It pinches her ears.”<br \><br \>

I see, thought Chō, who went back to his home and made two holes in the hat. Then he tried the hat on the donkey again, pulling her ears through the holes. But when he made her walk, she still limped. Angry, he went back to the sage shouting, but the sage just replied, “No, with that hat, her ears are too cold.”<br \><br \>

I see, so that’s the problem, Chō thought, and this time he made two long ear-covers. But the donkey limped just as before. ‘This sage has tricked me again!’ Chō thought, rushing back to him with fists raised, but the sage just replied, “Hold it, are you daft? With that hat, she can’t hear a thing!”<br \><br \>

Well, that’s true, thought Chō, going back to his home. But this time, he didn’t know what to do. If he made holes in the ear-covers, the wind would get in and make the donkey cold.<br \><br \>

For ten, then twenty days, Chō sat thinking, hardly eating, but he couldn’t come up with any good ideas. One day, he stopped a villager who was passing by and asked her, “What can I do to make this donkey hear?”<br \><br \>

“That’s nothing. Take off that hat,” the villager replied.<br \><br \>

“Now here’s a plan!” Chō shouted, and threw off the hat. Then he put his mouth up to the donkey’s ear and shouted, “Heeeeeey, donkey!” When he did, the donkey felt ticklish and twitched her ears a few times. Seeing this, Chō said, “Oh, she can hear! She can hear!” and danced for joy.<br \><br \>
